        "#Assignment : Python OOPs\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to represent data and methods to manipulate that data. It is based on four main principles:\n",
        "      - a. Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), restricting access to some components.\n",
        "      - b. Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features of an object.\n",
        "      - c. Inheritance: Allowing a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass), promoting code reuse.\n",
        "      - d. Polymorphism: Enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, allowing for methods to be used interchangeably.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - In OOP, a class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors of an object. It's a design pattern or template that defines the characteristics of an object.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - In Python, an object is an instance of a class, which represents a real-world entity, concept, or thing. It has its own set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that describe and define its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Abstraction\n",
        "    - Hides complex implementation details\n",
        "    - Exposes only necessary information through methods\n",
        "    - Example: A car's start_engine() method hides the complex process of starting the engine\n",
        "  -Encapsulation\n",
        "    - Bundles data and methods that operate on that data\n",
        "    - Controls access to data through methods\n",
        "    - Example: A class's __init__() method encapsulates the data and methods within the class\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\") are special methods in Python classes that start and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __repr__). They're used to override default behavior and provide custom implementation for operators, initialization, and more.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - Inheritance in OOP allows one class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class). It helps to reuse code and establish a hierarchy between classes. In Python, it’s implemented by defining a child class that inherits from a parent class.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in Python OOP:\n",
        "    - Ability of an object to take on multiple forms\n",
        "    - Achieved through method overriding, overloading, operator overloading, and function polymorphism.\n",
        "    - Example: len() function works with strings, lists, tuples, etc.\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation in Python:\n",
        "      - Achieved by using classes and objects\n",
        "      - Data (attributes) and methods are bundled together within a class\n",
        "      - Access to data is controlled through methods (e.g., getters and setters)\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - Constructor in Python:\n",
        "      - A special method that initializes an object when it's created\n",
        "      - Defined using the __init__() method\n",
        "      - Called automatically when an object is instantiated.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Class Method: A method that is bound to the class, not the instance. It takes cls as the first parameter and can modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "  - Static Method: A method that doesn't take self or cls as the first parameter. It works like a regular function but belongs to the class.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Method overloading in Python refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Python doesn't support traditional method overloading like some other languages, but it can be simulated by using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - Method Overriding in Python OOP:\n",
        "      - A child class provides a different implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "      - Child class method has same name, return type, and parameters as parent class method.   \n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python.\n",
        "  - Property Decorator in Python:\n",
        "      - Allows a method to be accessed like an attribute\n",
        "      - Used to implement getters, setters, and deleters for attributes\n",
        "      - Decorators: @property, @x.setter, @x.deleter\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?3\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in Python OOP:\n",
        "      - Allows for more flexibility and generic code\n",
        "      - Enables writing code that can work with different data types\n",
        "      - Promotes code reusability and reduces duplication\n",
        "      - Makes code more modular and easier to maintain\n",
        "15.  What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - Abstract Class in Python:\n",
        "      - A class that cannot be instantiated\n",
        "      - Designed to be inherited by other classes\n",
        "      - Can have both abstract and concrete methods\n",
        "      - Defined using the abc module and @abstractmethod decorator\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - Advantages of OOP in Python:\n",
        "      - 1. Code reusability\n",
        "      - 2. Easier maintenance\n",
        "      - 3. Improved readability\n",
        "      - 4. Enhanced modularity\n",
        "      - 5. Better organization\n",
        "      - 6. Simplified complexity\n",
        "      - 7. Improved scalability\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "   - Class Variable:\n",
        "      - Shared by all instances of the class\n",
        "      - Defined inside the class but outside any method\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Instance Variable:\n",
        "      - Unique to each instance of the class\n",
        "     - Defined inside a method using the self parameter\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - Multiple Inheritance in Python:\n",
        "      - A child class can inherit properties and methods from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "      - Child class inherits all attributes and methods from all parent classes.\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "  - __str__ Method\n",
        "      - Returns a human-readable string representation of the object\n",
        "      - Intended for end-users, providing a concise and informative string\n",
        "      - Used in print(), str(), and other functions that require a string representation\n",
        "\n",
        "  - __repr__ Method\n",
        "      - Returns a string representation of the object, useful for debugging and logging\n",
        "      - Should provide a more detailed and formal representation of the object\n",
        "      - Used in repr(), eval(), and other functions that require a string representation for technical purposes\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "  - Significance of super() function in Python:\n",
        "      - 1. Accessing parent class methods: Allows a child class to access and override methods of its parent class.\n",
        "      - 2. Method overriding: Enables a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "      - 3. Multiple inheritance: Helps resolve method name conflicts in multiple inheritance scenarios.\n",
        "      - 4. Code reusability: Facilitates code reusability by allowing child classes to build upon the functionality of their parent classes.\n",
        "21.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - Significance of __del__ method in Python:\n",
        "      - 1. Destructor: The __del__ method is a special method that serves as a destructor, allowing an object to clean up resources before it is garbage collected.\n",
        "      - 2. Resource deallocation: It is used to release system resources, such as file handles, network connections, or database connections, when an object is no longer needed.\n",
        "      - 3. Memory management: The __del__ method is called when an object's reference count reaches zero, indicating that it is no longer in use and can be safely deleted.\n",
        "      - 4. Custom cleanup: It allows developers to perform custom cleanup actions, such as saving data or logging information, before an object is destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  - Difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python:\n",
        "  - @staticmethod:\n",
        "      - 1. No access to class or instance: Static methods do not have access to the class or instance.\n",
        "      - 2. No implicit arguments: No implicit arguments (e.g., self or cls) are passed to the method.\n",
        "      - 3. Used for utility functions: Static methods are often used for utility functions that don't depend on the class or instance state.\n",
        "  - @classmethod:\n",
        "      - 1. Access to class: Class methods have access to the class through the cls parameter.\n",
        "      - 2. Implicit cls argument: The cls parameter is passed implicitly when the method is called.\n",
        "      - 3. Used for alternative constructors: Class methods are often used as alternative constructors or for creating class-level functionality\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  - In Python, polymorphism allows methods to operate differently based on the object invoking them, especially when combined with inheritance. This means that a single method can have varying behaviors across different classes that share a common parent.\n",
        "  - Method Overriding: A subclass can provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. When this method is called on an instance of the subclass, the subclass's version is executed, demonstrating polymorphism.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - In Python's OOP, method chaining is a technique that allows multiple method calls to be linked together in a single, fluent expression. This is achieved by designing methods that return the object instance (self) after performing their operations, enabling successive method invocations on the same object without requiring intermediate variables.\n",
        "  - Benefits:\n",
        "      - Improves code readability\n",
        "      - Reduces need for temporary variables\n",
        "      - Enables fluent interface design\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - Purpose of the __call__ method in Python:\n",
        "      - The __call__ method is a special method in Python classes that allows an instance of the class to be called as a function.\n",
        "      - When the __call__ method is defined in a class, instances of that class become callable, enabling them to behave like functions.\n",
        "  - Use cases:\n",
        "      - 1. Creating function-like objects: The __call__ method enables you to create objects that can be used as functions.\n",
        "      - 2. Implementing decorators: The __call__ method is often used when implementing decorators, which are functions that modify or extend the behavior of other functions.\n",
        "      - 3. Creating closures: The __call__ method can be used to create closures, which are functions that have access to their own scope and can capture variables from that scope."
